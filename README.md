## About Me

I'm an astrophysicist with extensive experience in data science, multi-messenger astronomy, and high-energy pulsar astronomy. I did my PhD at Monash University working under the supervision of Duncan Galloway which was conferred in July 2022. I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nature of this world and applying my transferrable skills to solve challenging problems. I am currently working on multi-messenger astronomy as a Research Fellow in GOTO collaboration. My work mainly focuses on solving computer vision problems using machine learning techniques and searching for gamma-ray burst optical counterparts.

Meanwhile, I vastly improved my technology skills by taking courses and working on some side projects. I believe that being a 'forever learner' is the key to success in this Big Data era.
